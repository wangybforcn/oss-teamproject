A program that recommends what to wear today based on weather conditions

Project Introduction:
  Crawling the current weather information through the python crawler and constructing an algorithm based on the weather information to recommend how to dress.
  We'll return a web page to display the results.
  
How to use:
  First download all the files, extract them into a folder.
  Then double-click to open the 옷차림.exe file.
  
  Tips: 
    Please check if your file contains the img folder, it contains the required images.
    We also provide the source code: getweather.py and main.py.
    After the first use, we will generate weatherinfo.txt and demo_1.html, which are used to store weather information and a webpage for displaying results respectively.
